These scripts are for interview purposes only!
All these scripts are created for snowflake.
All these scripts were build "blindly" without validation on a real database => the validation was done on small test databases (dummy data). Still, there can be errors!
These scripts are not important to life on the planet or its future, it's just an interview practice.
